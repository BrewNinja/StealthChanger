**Tool changing system for Vorons and other front mount printer motion systems.**

Based on Viesturz's work on [Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger)

## Introduction

Unlike the name suggests we support more then just stealthburner.

Due to difficulties with heat insert and aligning of bearings and mounts we wanted to try a more simplistic design based on bushings and pins.

This is a very light design, requiring less parts and as such is cheaper and easier to build.  Input shaper tests have shown it to be as rigid if not more than current Tapchanger.

All parts are easily replaceable without reprinting if wear happens, life of the bushings and pins are still being tested.

## Tool compatability
Currently we support the standard Stealth Burner, Dragon Burner, and Rapid Burner.  There are plans in place to add the Mini Stealth Burner, XOL, and Archetype.
