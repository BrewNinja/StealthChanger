# StealthChanger
Spinoff from [Viertuz Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger)

### WIP - STABLE TESTED AND WORKING BUT STILL WIP. BOM MAY CHANGE

Due to difficulties with heat insert and ligning of bearings and mounts i wanted to try a more simplistic design based on bushings and rods.

This version is very lite, requires less parts and as such is cheaper and easyer to build.  Input shaper tests have shown it to be as rigid if not better then current Tapchanger.

All parts are easily replaceable without reprinting if wear happens, life of the bushings and pins are still being tested.

## Tool compatability
Currently we support the standard Stealth Burner.  There are plans in place to sadd the Mini Stealth Burner, Dragon Burner and XOL.

## BOM and Printing
All print settings are the same as [Voron Standards](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings)

Orientation is flat on the parts back with supports enabled currently, we are working on models with integrated supports.

## Docks
Currently all docks used with [Viertuz Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger) are compatible.  In the future we might develop our own.

## Software
[Viertuz Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger).  The only changes will be in the toolhead config which you will find in the klipper directory in this repo.
