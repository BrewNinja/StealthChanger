Most of the code has been taken from the [TapChanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger)

You need `homing.cfg`, `macros.cfg`, `tool_detection.cfg` and `toolchanger.cfg` from [TapChanger Example](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger/tree/main/Klipper/config-example)

You must install [klipper-toolchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger/)

Toolchangers start with number 0, and count up. So for all the configs, make sure you change all sections. IE, in your T1 config, make sure its extruder1, fan1, etc. See the examples.
