Most of the code has been taken from the TapChanger repository: https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger

You must install klipper-toolchanger: https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger/

Toolchangers start with number 0, and count up. So for all the configs, make sure you change all sections. IE, in your T1 config, make sure its extruder1, fan1, etc. See the examples.
