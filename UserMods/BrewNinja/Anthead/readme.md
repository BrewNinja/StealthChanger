I was having some issues with the Anthead body fitting everything well and realized that I had some stuck support interfaces way in. Instead of dealing with that, I just edited N3MI's anthead mod for the Voron LGX. Thats why there is only 1 of them. You can now print this with either no supports, or only supports on the tall fins where the side fans go (I did the latter).

Also find an adapter plate for the HGX extruder. I couldn't find one, so here it is.
