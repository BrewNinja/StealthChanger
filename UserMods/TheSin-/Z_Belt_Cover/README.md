# SC Z Belt Cover

Originally designed by Akio in the Voron Usermods.

SC Logo added as a cutout, or a raised version.  The raised version needs 2 STLs that you combine in your slicer to allow for 2 colour printing. In Cura this is achieved by adding both to the plate, selecting an extruder per part, then select both then merge.
