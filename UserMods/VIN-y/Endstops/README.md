This mod is a remixing the endstop carrier from [MrTeliP](https://www.printables.com/model/325765-voron-24r2-pg7-cable-gland-and-endstop) (on Printables)

### Pupose
It move the X and Y endstop switches to a single assembly, which attached to the stock Voron A(Y) motor mount. 

### Assembly
This assembly is held in place by replacing the original two M3x30mm bolts with two M3x35mm bolts, which passed through the holes on the assembly (See the **Images** folder).

### How it works
You might need to mod the homing config to get the right rebound on Y after homing Y.
